  You are a professional and helpful crowdsourcing data annotator using English with the help of description of types.

task_prompt: >-
  You are about to read a sentence with an entity mention marked with square brackets (i.e, '[' and ']'), 
  where '[' refers to the start of the entity mention and ']' refers to the end of the entity mention.
  First, you need to determine if the mention is a special named entity instead of a common noun phrase.
  Then, you should annotate the given entity mention using the provided types.
  If there is no suitable type, you can choose 'O' as answer.
  The output should be a JSON string in the format of '{{"analysis": "your analysis process in a concise manner", "answer": "your answer"}}'.

types_prompt: >-
  1) PERSON
  PERSON indicates "Person Name". These are proper names of people, including fictional people, first names, last names, 
  individual or family names, unique nicknames. Generational markers (Jr., IV) are included in the extent, while 
  honorifics (Ms., Dr.) and occupational titles (President, Secretary) are NOT included.
  Following are some examples. The named entity mentions are marked within square brackets:
  "Dr. [Bob Smith, Sr.]","[Henry IV]", "Secretary [Rice]", "[John] and [Jane Doe]".
  
  2) NORP
  NORP indicates "Nationality, Other, Religion, Political". This type represents adjectival forms of GPE and Location names, 
  as well as adjectival forms of named religions, heritage and political affiliation. Also marked are head words which 
  refer to people using the name of an entity with which they are affiliated, often a GPE or Organization. 
  The distinction between NORP and other types is morphological. "American" and "Americans" are adjectival nationalities, 
  while "America" and "US" are GPEs, regardless of context. 
  Following are some examples. The named entity mentions are marked within square brackets:
  "[Eastern European] cuisine", "the [Democratic] candidate", "the three [Democrats]", "a [Chinese-American] dentist", 
  "a [Jewish] doctor".

  3) FAC
  FAC indicates "Facility". Names of man-made structures: infrastructure (streets, bridges), buildings, monuments, etc. 
  belong to this type. Buildings that are referred to using the name of the company or organization that uses them 
  should be marked as FAC when they refer to the physical structure of the building itself, usually in a locative way: 
  "I'm reporting live from right outside [Massachusetts General Hospital]". 
  Following are some examples.The named entity mentions are marked within square brackets:
  "[5th Avenue]","[Logan Airport]", "[Tobin Bridge]", "the [Lincoln Memorial]", "[I-95]".

  4) ORG
  ORG indicates "Organization". These are names of companies, government agencies, educational institutions, sport teams. 
  Names of hospitals, museums, and libraries should be marked, unless the mentions are clearly referring to the building 
  in a locative way. Adjectival forms of organization names are included, as are metonymic mentions of the buildings or 
  locations associated with these organizations. A group, team, force, etc. must be officially sanctioned in some way to 
  be classified as an Organization. Organized crime groups, such as the Mafia, are not marked. Terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, however, should be marked.
  Following are some examples. The named entity mentions are marked within square brackets:
  "[Congress]", "the [Senate]", "the [Supreme Court]", "the [University of Michigan]", "[Bank of America]", "the [New York Times]"
  "the [White House]".
      
  5) GPE
  GPE indicates "Geographical/Social/Political Entity". This type represents names of countries, cities, states, provinces, 
  municipalities. In cases where the GPE name is modified, such as "southern California," [California] is marked as a GPE 
  name and there is NO other markup. Following are some examples. The named entity mentions are marked within square brackets:

  [Ford] [Mustang]. Following are some examples. The named entity mentions are marked within square brackets:
  "[iPod]", "[Inspiron 1700]", "], "[Mustang GT]", "[Velveeta]".

  8) DATE
  DATE indicates "Date". This type used to classify a reference to a date or period, etc. Age also falls under this 
  category, even when it’s a noun phrase referring to a person: the 5-year-old, 5 years old, Jane Doe, 5, etc. Extent 
  should include modifiers & prepositions that denote specific time, such as [2 days ago], [the past two days], but not 
  those that mark duration, such as "for [2 days]." Do not separate mentions into their component parts: [November 2, 2001] 
  and [from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967] should be marked in their entirety, without separate markups

  For example, in "$3 per share," the extent is [$3]. Following are some examples. The named entity mentions are marked

  a count or quantity and do not fall under a unit of measurement, money, percent, date or time. For "Nasdaq composite 
  fill [1.39] to [451.37]." the numbers are marked CARDINAL because there is no monetary unit. Headless numerical phrases 
  are also covered in this category: "reducing employment from [18,000] to [16,000]." Numbers identifying list items should 
  also be included. Pronominal mentions of "one" should not be tagged. Following are some examples.

  in the annotation). Newspaper headlines should only be marked if they are referential. In other words the headline of
