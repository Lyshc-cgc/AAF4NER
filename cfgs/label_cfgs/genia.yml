labels:
  DNA:
    natural: DNA
    description: >-
      indicates "deoxyribonucleic acid". DNA is an acid in the chromosomes in the centre of the cells of living things. 
      DNA determines the particular structure and functions of every cell and is responsible for characteristics being 
      passed on from parents to their children.

  RNA:
    natural: RNA
    description: >-
      indicates "ribonucleic acid". RNA is an acid in the chromosomes of the cells of living things which plays an 
      important part in passing information about protein structure between different cells.

  protein:
    natural: protein
    description: >-
      indicates "protein". Proteins are a large class of biological molecules consisting of chains of amino acids called 
      polypeptides. A single polypeptide can make a protein, although many proteins consists of multiple polypeptide subunits.

  cell_type:
    natural: cell type
    description: >-
      indicates "cell type". a cell type is a classification used to distinguish between morphologically or 
      phenotypically distinct cell forms within a species. 

  cell_line:
    natural: cell line
    description: >-
      indicates "cell line". a clone of animal or plant cells that can be grown in a suitable nutrient culture medium in the laboratory
